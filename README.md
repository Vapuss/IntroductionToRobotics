# IntroductionToRobotics ~ 2023-2024
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey there, this is the repo for the 3rd year course, Intro to Robotics, followed at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. You can expect to see here weekly commits regarding the various homeworks and projects undertaken at this course, and their requirements, alongside all the materials I deemed important for completing these tasks, such as implementation details, code, videos and image files.

<summary> <h2>Homework 1</h2> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assignment focused on controlling each of the RGB LED collors ~ Red, Green and Blue ~ using three individual potentiometers. This being the first task making use of the Arduino Uno board and the Arduino IDE, clean code and correct use of the hardware components were of the utmost importance to ensure establishing good practice.

### Components used:
* Arduino Uno Board
* Breadboard
* RGB Led
* Resistances of 330 Ohm (3)
* Potentiometers (3)
* Jumper Cables


  **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the homework's final form, alongside a video demonstrating its functionality:**

<summary> <h2>Homework 2</h2> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assignment involved simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. The completion of this task ensured gaining experience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques, and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.


### Components used:
* Arduino Uno Board
* Breadboard
* Leds(4 : 3 representing the floors and 1 for the working state of the elevator)
* Resistances of 330 Ohms (4)
* Push-Buttons(3)
* Buzzer
* Jumper Cables

<summary> <h2>Homework 3</h2> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week's task involved using the joystick to control the position of the 7 Segments Diplay's... segment and "drawing" on it's.... display ( :< ). The movement between segments
had to be natural, meaning they should jump from the current position only to neighbors, but without passing through "walls". I also added a buzzer to know when the reset and drawing took place.

### Components used:
* Arduino Uno Board
* Breadboard
* Joystick
* 7 Segments Display
* Resistances of 330 Ohms (9)
* Buzzer(for annoyance purposes)
* Jumper Cables

<summary> <h2>Homework 4</h2> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The task for this week was the building of a basic stopwatch with start/pause, reset and lapping functionalities. The building part made use of the 4 Digit Seven Segment Diplay, 3 push-buttons and an unimaginable amount of jumper wires. The second real challenge after the delicate placement of the resistors and the wires on the breadboard was the building of the code itself, meeting the assigned requirements and achieving a correct, logical solution being of the utmost importance, as well as maintaining a neat and tidy coding style.

### Components used:
* Arduino Uno Board
* Breadboard
* 3 Push-Buttons
* Four Digit 7 Segments Display
* Resistances of 330 Ohms (8)
* One 74HC595 Shift Register
* Jumper Cables(so so many)

<summary> <h2>Extra Homework 1</h2> </summary>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The task intended for this extra homework was about making use of the Ultrasonic Sensor and the Servo motor to create a working radar, which used the Processing IDE to get a classic radar visualisation, like the one we see in movies with ships. A somewhat of a challenge was posed by the fact that I had to build a makeshift support for the US Sensor from cardboard, but it worked great in the end.

### Components used:
* Arduino Uno Board
* Breadboard
* Servo Motor
* HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
* Sensor Support
* Jumper Cables
