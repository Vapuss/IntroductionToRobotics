# IntroductionToRobotics ~ 2023-2024
Hey there, this is the repo for the 3rd year course, Intro to Robotics, followed at the University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science. You can expect to see here weekly commits regarding the various homeworks and projects undertaken at this course, and their requirements, alongside all the materials I deemed important for completing these tasks, such as implementation details, code, videos and image files. 

## Homework 1

  This assignment focused on controlling each of the RGB LED collors ~ Red, Green and Blue ~ using three individual potentiometers. This being the first task making use of the Arduino Uno board and the Arduino IDE, clean code and correct use of the hardware components were of the utmost importance to ensure establishing good practice.

  **Components used:** 
    + Arduino Uno Board
    + Breadboard
    + RGB Led
    + Resistances of 330 Ohm (3)
    + Potentiometers (3)
    + Jumper Cables


  This is the homework's final form, alongside a video demonstrating its functionality:
